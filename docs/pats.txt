Patterns:

Expr = ... | Case Expr [Pat]

Pat = 
    Ppc E.PitchClass
    Pn Integer
    Pd Double
    Pb Bool
    Pnote ??
    Prest ??
    Plist [Pat]
    Psnip {Pat}
    Pvar
    Pwc -- wildcard

Should notes and rests be values or exprs? Or some pattern-specific thing? Or
patterns? (Which would basically echo the Expr Note definition, except with Pat
instead of Expr.)

- E.Note: Since we're evaluating the given Expr, this might make sense; however,
  the user will be providing a Breve Note, not an E.Note, in the pattern.
- Expr: Easier to match, probably?
- Pat implementation of Note: Makes the most sense; Pat version of Note. Will
  need to add parsing for patterns though -- will be highly redundant.

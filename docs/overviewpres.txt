Presentation: (5 minutes -- 5 slides or so!)

Background:
    - Prodirect Manipulation (talk about SVGs a little bit)
        - Bridging the gap between programmatic and direct manipulation!
Music Representations
    - Graphically: Finale, Sebelius, Rosegarden (?)
        - Virtual score, skeuemorphism of physically writing music
    - Programs: e.g. CSound or Music-V family
Audio DSLs
    - Quite a number of them!
    - Mostly decedents of MUSIC-N, a family of audio DSLs created in 1957
        - Most popular is CSound, in that it actually is updated
Motivation:
    - How well can prodirect manipulation be adapted to music?
    - The virtual score is equiv to parts of image
    - Update CSound program in real time
    - Advantages of interoperability are pretty obvious!
    - CSound has wide capabilities, will probably limit research to only score
      <-> program for now, not worrying about synths.
Challenges:
    - Obviously not a 1-1 mapping
    - CSound not functional, unlike little

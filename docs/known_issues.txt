Known Issues with Breve:

- Empty Snippets: What is an empty snippet? It parses, but cannot be evaluated.
    -> Perhaps the best solution is {} = {(rest 0)} (or just (rest 0)), which is
at least superficially consistent with Euterpea.
    -> On the other hand, {} in a pattern behaves just like [], AS LONG AS it's
embedded in a pattern, e.g. (x:{}). Just matching {} isn't possible, since the
empty snippet is undefined.

Possible Texts and Examples:

Parsing:
- Try each parser over possible domains
    - PitchClass: Reads a note and returns that note
    - Number: Reads a *positive* integer or double and returns that number
    - Rest: Reads "(rest <num>)" correctly
    - Note: Reads "(pc o d)" correctly
    - Snippet: "{x}", "{x,y}", etc. (still need to solve empty snippet problem!
    - List: "[]", "[x]", etc.
    - all operations
    - both kinds of function application
    - etc.
    - The parsers for simpler/base expressions are obviously easier to test.
- Parsing Prelude (just passing?)

Evaluation:
- Checking prelude functions work

Tracing:
- Expression traces calculated correctly.

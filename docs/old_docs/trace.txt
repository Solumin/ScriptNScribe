OK, that should be all the notes I need to do trace-based synthesis for Breve.

Source code locations: Not just numeric literals, but also pitchclass. (Which is
basically an enum.) Plus we have two numeric literal types, ints and doubles.
(Which are basically invisible to the user, they're still two separate types.)

Expression traces: I'm not sure these are any different.
Their prim ops: + - * / ^ % atan (???)
    Inversion results in Maybe, so not all ops have to be invertible.
Our prim ops: + - * /

A better idea might be to work "backwards".
They based their design off the idea that user will be manipulating shapes,
which will change numeric values in the program.
In Breve, user manipulate notes, rests and snippets.
- Notes: Change pitch (and octave) and duration
- Rests: Duration
- Snippets: Constituent NOTES and RESTS.
=> Traceable ops: mathematic! Only +, -, * and / for now. Other ops will come
along later. Pitch is ONLY +/- integers, so that's easy. Others are obviously
more complex.

OK, so what do I need to do to set up tracing?
- Numeric Traces (Get these from parsing)
- Expression Traces (get these from evaling!)
- Map of locations to literals (That is, the numeric traces.)

TRACES record A VALUE and its LOCATION -or- the EXPRESSION used to create it, IN
TERMS OF other TRACES.
- TrLoc Loc
- TrOp op trace trace
- TrUn op trace
THESE ARE BOUND TO A VALUE. That is, we could just have [Val] be our "traces",
though it might be useful to have the location easier to access.

IN ADDITION, there is the MAPPING of LOCATIONS to CONSTANTS. This is GENERATED
DURING PARSING, -if- I understand what they're using it for.

REALLY they're the same thing -- the traces that are just locations -> val are
contained in the list of all traces.

So from eval we should get a LIST of TRACES (TrLoc and TrOp and TrUn). The ones
that are TrLoc are the CONSTANTS. We all the constants during parse, and
generate the expression ones during eval.
Thing is, we're currently getting all the traces during eval by walking over
the tree. This DOES NOT work. Consider "1/4" -- parse gives us 1 and 4, but
eval only gives us (/ 1 4) so that's the only one we get afterward.
The solution is to build the list of traces as we eval. That SHOULD capture all
of them. But how to do that? Passing along a second part of the env is one
option, but would require a LOT of rewriting.
Consider evalBinOp:
    evalExpr (BinOpExpr op e1 e2) = evalBinOp op (evalE e1) (evalE e2)
You'd have to get the traces (evalE e1) and (evalE e2), add them to the list,
then add trace from evalBinOp to the list. That's... a lot. It's not impossible
but holy fuck it would be messy.
This is a pretty good use case for the state monad, I think. Or more
specifically the writer, since eval doesn't do anything besides record the
traces.

Currently, traces are lists of Expressions, specifically PitchClass, N and D,
which have a location imbedded inside them.
Need to add Expression Traces. Obviously this just means extending evalBinOp --
but that ACTUALLY means extending the entire eval ecosystem.

Focusing on just the 4 binary math ops, we can extend Trace to be:
    Trace = TrLoc Loc | TrOp BinOp Trace Trace
The 3 exprs still have a Loc inside them, put there during parsing.
During synth, locations are compared. So maybe also make a map of locations to
constants as we go along. (we did this during synth last time -- could do it
again, might be simpler?)

Then with expression traces:
- Val for PitchClass, N and D have Loc added to them
- evalBinOp Add, Sub, Mult and Div record traces in returned values.

This SHOULD include the traces created during parsing and in fact I don't know
I need to return traces from parsing now!

Good example of trace: Arpeggio! (Of course!)

Consider arpeggio([0,4,7], (D 4 1/4))
The input snippet is (D 4 1/4)
The output is the arpeggio (D 4 1/4), (Fs 4 1/4), (A 4 1/4)
If the user adjusts the output to be (Cs 4 1/4), (Fs 4 1/4), (A 4 1/4), it
should synth [0, 4, 7] -> [-1, 4, 7] (well just the 0 changes) though it can
also change (D 4 1/4) to (Cs 4 1/4)

---
OK, getting traces is done. Now to do the actual evaluation.
Evaluation gives us:
- Traces (list of traced vals) (from which we can extract mapping of locations
  to constants in the original program)

(1,1) -> 4
Output: -4 = (TrUn Neg (TrLoc (1,1)))
Update: -5 = (TrUn Neg (TrLoc (1,1)))
Choose: (1,1)
SimpleB will take this and apply the inverse op:
5 = (TrLoc (1,1))
Result: (1,1) -> 5

In our parlance,
(1,1) -> 4 is also (Vn 4 (TrLoc (1,1)))
(Vn -5 (TrUn Neg (TrLoc (1,1))))
SimpleB will take this and apply the inverse op:
(Vn 5 (TrLoc (1,1)))

(1,1) -> 4
(1,2) -> 2
Output: 6 = (TrOp Add (TrLoc (1,1), TrLoc(1,2)))
Update: 7 = (TrOp Add (TrLoc (1,1), TrLoc(1,2)))
Choose: (1,1)
7 = (TrOp Add (TrLoc (1,1)) (TrLoc (1,2)))
Invert over Sub, (1,1)
Sub 7 (lookup (1,2)) -> 7 - 2 => 5
Update: 5 = (TrLoc (1,1))
Result: (1,1) -> 5

InvL op (rho t1) val = t2
InvR op val (rho t2) = t1

Remember, we're solving for a single location. It may not be one of the two in
the ops. So we have to take the union of solving the two branches.

But why the two branches? Well, we have to choose *one* of them to eventually
resolve to the base case. Recursion is the best way.

-> TrLoc is the base case
-> TrUn is just unwrapping, no branching needed.
-> TrOp is more complex.

I need an example to work though.
(1,1) -> 4
(1,2) -> 2
(1,3) -> 3
+ (* (4 (-2))) 3 = -5
Output: -5 = (TrOp Add (TrOp Mult (TrLoc (1,1)) (TrUn Neg (1,2))) (TrLoc (1,3)))
Update: -9 = (TrOp Add (TrOp Mult (TrLoc (1,1)) (TrUn Neg (1,2))) (TrLoc (1.3)))
---
Choose: (1,1)
-9 = (...) + 3 => -12 = (* (1,1) (-(1,2)))

n = i op j
n inv i = j
n inv j = i

8 = 6 + 2
8 - 6 = 2
8 - 2 = 6

3 = 4 - 1
4 - 3 = 1
3 + 1 = 4

3 = 6 / 2
6 / 3 = 2
6 * 2 = 6

6 = 3 * 2
6 / 3 = 2
6 / 2 = 3

D = C + 2
D - C = 2
D - 2 = C

OK! That's working. Next step: MULTIPLE updates.

Tracing (Notes from the paper)
==============================

Sec. 3
Two kinds of traces:
- Source code locations: Records that numeric literal n originates from a
  particular location in the program.
    - Easy to update values in real time as user manipulates output
    - Have no effect on evaluation of program
    - Inserted implicitly by parser
- Expression Traces: Combinations of smaller traces during the evaluation of
  primitive operations.
    - Prim ops: addition, multiplication, etc.
    - little records the structure of expressions when evaluating prim ops
    - e.g. xi = (+ x0 (* i sep)) is a(n abstract) trace. For each i, would
      generate xi = (+ x0 (* iN sep)) (i.e. would have i1, i2...)
    - Also create map of variables to run-time values:
        p = [x0 -> 40, sep -> 110, i0 -> 0, i1 -> 1,...]

Synthesizing updates:
- Continued example: Using xi = (+ x0 (* i sep)), program generates 3 boxes with
  xi = 40, xi = 150, xi = 260.
- User drags third box so now xi = 304 (instead of 260):
    304 = (+ x0 (* i3 sep))
- Obviously, current bindings in p don't satisfy this equation! Goal is to synth
  program that satisfies this new equation, & also satisfied xi = 40 & xi = 150

Structural Updates:
- "Non-local" updates. Arbitrary changes to original program -- ASTs of the two
  progs are not necessarily related.
- In s-n-s, inferred structural updates will "hardcode" new shapes.

Local Updates:
- Only change numeric literals. Basically just a new substitution.
- Example: 304 = (+ x0 (* i3 sep)). Three possible changes:
    x0 -> 84 or sep -> 132 or i3 -> 2.4
    - That is, move all the boxes over, increase the distance between them, or
      changes the index used to calculate (which actually acts just like the
      structural update!)
    - Design constraints prevent synth from changing multiple variables.
- Frozen Constants: Synth may try to change constants that user doesn't want to
  change. Can explicitly "freeze" them to prevent changes.
- Programming with integers: little provides funcs that do prim ops in terms of
  addition. Much simpler for synth, usable only by integers though.

Ambiguities:
- Ad Hoc: Ask user to chose best updates. Use value distance metric that
  compares similarities between progs to rank updates.
- Live mode: Real-time, so don't ask user about ambiguities.
    - Don't infer structural updates. Expect user to make "large" design changes
      themselves.
    - Use rotating assignment when deciding what updates to synthesise.
    - That is, try to have each location (trace) updated few times as possible.
      If two traces both have x0 and sep, they each update only on of those.

Trace-Based Program Synthesis (the actual algo) (Sec. 4)
- Insight 1: GUI manipulations typically change NUMERIC attributes
- Insight 2: Control flow rarely changes between runs, so traces only record
  "data flow"
- Traces: either location l or expression (op t1 ... tm) that records prim op
  that was applied to traces t1 ... tm.

Program Synthesis Problem:
    - Output of program may contain k numeric attributes and user may manipulate
      0 <= j <= k of them.
    - j changed values become j hard constraints (nj' = tj). Unchanged values
      are soft constraints. Helps avoid to unsastifiable equations.
- Context: value context V is  value with m > 0 placeholders (holes)
    V = hole_i | n | s | b | [] | [V1 | V2] | (\ p e)
- Substitutions: Substitution p is a mapping from program locations to numbers.
- Goal: Faithful local updates.
    - Faithful: User-updated values (hard constraints) are maintained in new program.
    - Soft constraints are ignored, but impact of ignoring them is limited by
      distance ranking.

Synthesising Faithful Updates:
- 3 Design principles:
    - I) Solve only one equation at a time
    - II) Solve only univariate equations
    - III) Solve equations only in simple, stylized forms.
- Keep algorithm simple and fast
- Given: User updates m values, nt1 ... ntm, which creates set of trace-value
  equations {n1' = t1, ..., nm' = tm}. Let p0 be mapping of locations to numbers
  in original program.
    1. Define Li = Locs(ti) to be set of prog locations (constants, really) that
    occur in ti, each of which is a candidate "varable" to solve for.
    2. Define Li' to be locs that are ONLY in ti. (Disjoint w/ Union of Lj i/=j)
    3. With (l1,...,lm) from L1' x ... x Lm' (one loc from each disjoin set)
    4. ki = Solve(p0, li, ni' = ti), update li -> ki to p0.
- Two different implementations of "Solve" function.
    - Addition only: Count # of occurences c of the unknown variable. Divide
      partial sum s by c. ???
    - Single-occurence: Unknown loc var occurs exactly ONCE in equation. Uses
      inverses of prim ops.
- Ranking - look at later if necessary, don't worry about it right now.

Plausible Updates:
- SynthesizeFaithful does not solve for prog locs that appear in more than one
  trace. Overly restrictive in some cases! Need a relaxed version.
- Plausible updates: Synth only satisfies some of user's changes.
- Synthesizing: Similar to previous, but having variables overlap. Choose
  arbitrary locs from each trace!

RANDOM SHIT TO THROW IN THE PAPER
- Snippets in breve currently defined as a note or rest or sequence thereof.
  With a stronger type system, can have stronger semantic meaning of rests.
    - E.g. functions that user can interact with can explicitly be of snippet
      type.
- Error handling

Simplifications of language:
- Lists nominally homogeneous, but no checks for that
- Functions don't make sure param names are unique, or that # args = # params.

"Breve, while not necessarily a strongly-typed language, is at least opinionated
about types. It doesn't care that your lists are heteregenous -- though it
should -- but it certainly won't let you fill a note with pitches."
